# Rocket Simulation

## Project Description

This program simulates the trajectory of a rocket and tell us at what time we should launch the rocket in order to achieve the international space station.
It will
1. Calculate ISS coordinates ("*coord_skyfield.py*")
2. Find the parameters ("*simulation.c*") and plot the graphs ("*graphs.py*")
3. Determine launch time ("*simulation.c*")


## Project Structure

### Files description
Inputs:
- "*stations.txt*" is downloaded by "*coord_skyfield.py*"

Ouputs:
- "*output.txt*" is a semi-colon delimited file
- "*ouput_coords.txt*" is a single line file
- "*final_ouput.txt*" is a two line file

Code:
- "*coord_skyfield.py*" contains a function that returns the coordinates of ISS at the time of interest
- "*graphs.py*" plots the graphs for our parameters over time
- "*simulation.c*" contains the code to run the simulation


### Implementation details

Overview
- The code is compiled and run on C. It calls Python functions with the "system" function.
- Python is used to plot the graphs and find variables with the specific Python library Skyfield
- C is used to find the needed parameters and output of the program


## Instructions
To run the code, first compile *simulation.c*
```{bash}
gcc simulation.c
```
And then run it

```{bash}
./a.exe
```



## Requirements
```{bash}
$python --version
Python 3.11.4

$gcc --version
gcc.exe (Rev7, Built by MSYS2 project) 13.1.0
```

You will also need to install the libraries found on the "*requirement.txt*" file, in particular, you will need to install the Python library Skyfield.
