# Most of the calculations of this code come from the skyfield documentation: https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/
# This is the personal website of Brandon Rhodes, skyfield library's creator
# We have mainly used the following subsections: https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/earth-satellites.html (Earth Satellites)
# and https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/positions.html (Positions)

# Some useful theory used in the calculations:
# ECEF = Earth-centered Earth-fixed reference system. It is inertial relative to the Earth, assimilated to ITRS
# GCRS = Geocentric Celestial Reference System
# Both are different coordinate reference frames used to define locations of specific bodies
# Conversion between them will be necessary for our calculations

# Skyfield vocabulary: "position" and "distance" are two different types of objects
